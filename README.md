#This project is about creating a recipe for a local delicacy - Jollof rice.
This is to demonstrate my understanding of the different types of links using HTML
I will be linking images with absolute and relative elements, creating both ordered and unordered lists amongst others and finally committing and pushing this project to github.
Thank you.
