<p> <strong> Akara </strong> refers to black-eyed pea fritters. It’s a common Nigerian 
    street food and breakfast dish that’s popular throughout West 
    Africa and Brazil where it’s known as acarajé. It’s believed 
    that the dish was brought to Brazil by West African slaves.</p>

    <P> Akara is made with just four ingredients – black-eyed peas, 
        onions, salt, and pepper. It’s similar to moin moin in that 
        it’s made with pureed black-eyed peas, but instead of being 
        steamed, it’s deep-fried. It can be eaten on its own or served 
        with other Nigerian foods like pap (African corn pudding) or bread.</p>
