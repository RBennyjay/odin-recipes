<p> <strong> Jollof rice </strong> is a West African dish that’s a staple 
    in most households. It definitely was a staple in 
    my house growing up, and at parties, where you can 
    rest assure that there will be pans and pans of it. 
     <em><strong> This is first reason I love attending </em></strong>
     parties. Second would have to be for the music and 
    dancing. It’s just too much fun. I like this, Lets go!</p>

 <p>There are many different ways to cook Jollof Rice. 
    It is a dish made with rice, tomatoes, tomato paste, 
    onions, red bell pepper, scotch bonnet peppers, salt, 
    and spices. If it doesn’t have the above mentioned 
    ingredients, then it’s not true <a href="https://izzycooking.com/jollof-rice/" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer"> Jollof Rice</a>. 
    I make it the way my mum taught me, and I usually call it Nigerian 
    Jollof because of the type of the rice that is used. <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/jollof-rice-recipe-23214234" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ingredients</a>
    Nigerians use the long grain rice that has been parboiled. 
    Other versions i.e. Ghanaian Jollof will use basmati or 
    jasmine rice. Thats it!</p>
